## Graduate Researcher -- January 2021 to April 2026

*McGill University, Montreal, Canada*

- **Characterizing** the temperature and pressure effects on the interfacial tensionand energy of interfaces in empty, propane, isobutane, and methane-propane sII gas hydrates.
- **Modeling** structures and local organizations present near and far from gashydrate interfaces.
- **Developing** a postprocessing pipeline using numpy, pandas, numexpr,multiprocessing, and scikit-learn to efficiently analyze large datasets andcumbersome trajectories.
- **Evaluating** and implementing analysis acceleration using numpy, numexpr, andmultiprocessing.
- **Using** Microsoft Windows and Linux computational environments for analysis tasks.
- **Implementing** computational, analytical, and theoretical modeling of crystallineproperties and interfacial processes and phenomena of gas hydrates using highperformance computing clusters.
- **Maintaining** a Python module containinin useful tools and features for theMaterials Modeling Research Group installable privately via the pip packagemanager.
