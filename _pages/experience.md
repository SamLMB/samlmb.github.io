## Graduate Researcher -- January 2021 to Present

### *McGill University, Montréal, Canada*
- **Characterizing** temperature and pressure effects on the interfacial tension and energy   of interfaces in sII gas hydrates.
- **Using** machine learning to identify trends and patterns in large datasets, classify structures, recognize clustering.
- **Modeling** structures and local organizations present near and far from gas hydrate  interfaces.
- **Developing** processing pipelines using numpy, pandas, numexpr, multiprocessing, scikit-learn on HPC clusters.
- **Implementing** computational, analytical, and theoretical modeling of crystalline  properties and interfacial processes and phenomena of gas hydrates using high performance   computing clusters.
- **Maintaining** a Python module containining useful tools and features for the Materials  Modeling Research Group installable privately via the pip package manager.
